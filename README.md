# girlsday23

There are three example images in the `images` folder. Feel free to add more to experiment (these will be ignored by git). 

Ways to change the output:
- change (fake) backend
- change the circuit
- change number of repetitions of the circuit
- change number of qubits (up to 8)
- change number of shots
